# ProjectGraph
Version: 1.7.1

Known Issues

- ProjectGraph is not generic and is directly tied to several MITRE apis.
- ProjectGraph supports two graphs on the same page, although there do exist issues with the VIKI extension.
- Tag display is still set to an alert box and probably should be changed to a popup display.
- Zoom to fit does not always work and should be looked at again.
- Searching by tags has not been developed
- One of the javascript libraries (contextmenu.js) can be found at https://github.com/avecchio/contextmenu
